# Responsive-Web-Design

Hi there;

I'm Ege. Currently I am a sophomore in Bogazici University studying Computer Engineering. 

This is my first repository to show my improvement on HTML5 and CSS with the guidance of freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Courses. I will publish my certification projects in here to keep track of my process and make them visible for community to get constructive criticism. I hope you enjoy my projects...
